# Collaborative To-Do List Application

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The **Collaborative To-Do List Application** is a Java-based application that enables multiple users to manage and collaborate on shared to-do tasks via a command-line interface or GUI. Each user can add, remove, or mark tasks as complete. Tasks can be categorized and are user-assignable, enabling better task tracking and productivity.

This project demonstrates core software engineering principles, including object-oriented programming (OOP), multithreading for concurrency, and data persistence.
